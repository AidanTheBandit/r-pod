3. Click **"Switch account"**

2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Paste and press Enter:
   ```javascript
   copy(document.cookie)
   ```
4. ✅ Cookie is now in your clipboard!

#### Step 3: Update .env
1. Open: `/Users/aidanpds/Downloads/r1-ipod-ui-plugin/ipod-music-app/backend-python/.env`
2. Find: `YOUTUBE_MUSIC_COOKIE="`
3. Replace the value (keep the quotes):
   ```env
   YOUTUBE_MUSIC_COOKIE="paste-your-entire-cookie-here"
   ```
4. **Save the file**

#### Step 4: Restart Backend
In terminal (where Python is running):
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then restart:
cd /Users/aidanpds/Downloads/r1-ipod-ui-plugin/ipod-music-app/backend-python
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```
