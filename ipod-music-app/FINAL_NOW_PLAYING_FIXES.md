# Final Now Playing Fixes - Clean Design + Audio Authentication

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Audio Stream Authentication Fixed** ✅
**Problem:** Audio was getting 401 Unauthorized because the password wasn't being properly added to the stream URL.

**Root Cause:** URL constructor was failing silently or the password parameter wasn't being appended.

**Solution:**
- Added try-catch around URL construction
- Ensured full absolute URL before creating URL object
- Properly append password as query parameter
- Server accepts password from both query param AND header

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Silent failure
const url = new URL(fullStreamUrl)

// After: Proper error handling
try {
  const url = new URL(fullStreamUrl)
  url.searchParams.set('password', BACKEND_PASSWORD)
  fullStreamUrl = url.toString()
} catch (e) {
  console.error('[BackendClient] Failed to parse URL:', fullStreamUrl, e)
}
```

### 2. **Design Reverted to Match App Aesthetic** ✅
**Problem:** Dark theme didn't match the clean, light design of the rest of the app.

**Solution:** Reverted to light, clean design consistent with the app:

**Color Scheme:**
- Background: `#f8f9fa` (light gray)
- Text: `#1a1a1a` (dark), `#555` (artist), `#777` (album)
- Progress ring: `#007bff` (blue) on `#e0e0e0` (light gray) background
- Buttons: White with subtle shadows and borders
- Hover states: `#f8f9fa` background

**Layout:**
- Album art: 220x220px with rounded corners (12px)
- Progress ring: 260x260px (20px padding around art)
- Clean white buttons with subtle shadows
- Consistent spacing throughout

### 3. **Circular Progress Ring Refinements** ✅
- Thinner ring (4px instead of 6px)
- Light gray background ring (`#e0e0e0`)
- Blue progress ring (`#007bff`)
- Smooth transitions
- Properly sized for clean look
